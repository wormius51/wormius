            <p class="lead">
                In December 1st 2018, a game jam (an event where people make games of a particular theme, 
                in a short limited time) on <a href="https://ldjam.com/">Ludum Dare</a> started.
                The theme of the jam was "Sacrifices must be made".
                I got the idea of having the player sacrefice the ability to move to a certain direction.
                So, I started making a prototype in unity. Submitted my game to the jam.

                </a>
                Got some nice feedback. Thought about making a more full game out of it.
                But left it be for the time being.

            <h4 class="primaryText">Starting the new project</h1>
            <p class="lead">
                â€ŽFebruary 1st 2020, I created a new project in unity.
                The idea is to create a 3D version of the game this time.
                I started by making the object that were in the game using primitve mashes (cubes and spheres).
                I wanted to make the experience of the game consistant. 
                So, a little bit of collider adjuting was necessary.

            <h4 class="primaryText">Pickups</h1>
            <p class="lead">
                March 25th 2020, added pickable propellers.
                These are bubbles with a propeller inside. If you touch the bubble while missing at least one propeller,
                you get the propeller and the bubble disappears. There could be different kinds of propellers in the pickup bubble.
                So far I made a propeller that keeps going after hitting boxes, 
                and a propeller that make you fly up instead of to the side.

            <h4 class="primaryText">Multiplayer</h1>
            <p class="lead">
                April 18th 2020, I have started working on multiplayer.
                I got the idea of adding game modes that are typical of first person shooters.
                The first mode I am going for is capture the flag. The flag being a propeller type.
                <img src="/images/showoffs/ctf_capture.gif" alt="Really Bad Flying Machine">
                If a player shoots at an enemy, the enemy losses propellers.
                If a player shoots at an ally, if the ally has a propeller missing, they get the propeller that was shot.
                I'm useing the udpClient to send bytes between the host and the client (One player hosts the game).
                Another thing I added is a type of propeller that drops and explodes on impact.
